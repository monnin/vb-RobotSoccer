Robot Soccer Client/Server - Simplified Soccer For Programming Courses

This is a Visual Basic client/server systemimplementation of robot soccer. Both rules of the game and the physics have been simplified for teaching coding using Visual Basic. By design, the ball cannot leave the soccer field and bounces off of the walls (so more like robot hockey in that aspect). The ball has "friction", but the friction is applied linearly (each move removes x% of the current speed in both the x and y axis). Kinetic energy is transfered from the robots to the ball (and between the robots) in an non-elastic energy-transfer approach (similar to "bumper cars").
Used at a community college for a second-term programming course.

As used in the class, the server was provided and students created the clients, so no "client" code will be found here.
